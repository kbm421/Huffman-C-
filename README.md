# Huffman-C-
1. Done Encoding part. Used Priority queue(MinHeap)
- Node.cpp file has both class and constructer of the Node object
- HED.cpp file has all parts of the encoding.
- Most parts have it's own comments so it is pretty much explaind what part what.
# !NEED TO FIX
- The way that I'm saving file isn't what we suppose to do.
- It should have code + char on top of the file '*****' to divide top table and actuall compressed code part.
- top of the compressed code part, should show total bits from the compressed file
